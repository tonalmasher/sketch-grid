# sketch-grid
### My attempt at making an etch-a-sketch style grid via jQuery
* I'm making a site with a grid of square divs.
* I've added a hover effect so it changes the color of the square when your mouse passes over it, leaving a (pixelated) trail through your grid like a pen would.
* I've added a button to the top of the screen which will clear the current grid and send the user a popup asking for how many squares per side to make the new grid.
* Instead of just changing the color of your grid from white to some color, the squares will get darker on each pass, so they'll eventually be black.

* Finally I'll push the project to GitHub
